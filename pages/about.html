    <!-- bio -->
    <p>bio<br> Knisely is a Columbus, Ohio-based quartet performing original music for violin, clarinet, vibraphone and piano. Since forming in late 2019, Knisely has worked to build an audience virtually through the pandemic. Their genuine and inviting online performances created a dialogue between the performers and the audience, a direction the group wishes to preserve in live performances. Their sound is engaging and memorable with a unique instrumentation and tuneful compositions.</p>
